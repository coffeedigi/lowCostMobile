    <h4>Personal data relating to minors and other vulnerable people</h4>
    <p>We may also collect or receive personal data relating to minors (which might be defined differently in different jurisdictions), particularly but not exclusively when processing personal injury insurance claims.  We recognize that personal data relating to minors and other vulnerable people is particularly sensitive.  However we treat all personal and other confidential data as needing to be kept secure and confidential, so all data is treated as needing appropriate protection.</p>

    <p>We do not knowingly collect online information from children under the age of 13. Our services are marketed towards adults of driving age. If we are notified that we have collected personal information, as defined by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), of a child under the age of 13, we will delete the information as expeditiously as possible.</p>

By using our Services, and submitting personal information to us, you consent to the collection, usage, storage, transfer, and disposition of your personal information—as set forth in this Privacy Policy—for all purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy, for all purposes required by law, and as instructed by you. </p>
    <p>We may share your personal information with third parties for the purposes described in this privacy notice under the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>We may share your personal information with <i>our insurers and their business partners for the purpose of processing claims and other insurance and company administration purposes</i>.  This includes reinsurance companies, other insurance agents or brokers, lawyers, actuaries, testifying experts, loss adjusters, claims handlers, etc.</li>
    <li>We may share your personal information with <i>our service providers and business partners that perform marketing services and other business operations for us</i>. For example, we may partner with other companies to process secure payments, fulfill orders, optimize our services, send newsletters and marketing emails, support email and messaging services and analyze information.</li>
    <li>We work closely with other businesses and companies that fall under the <i>Low Cost Insurance family of companies and our parent groups, including Risk Placement Services, Inc. (“RPS”) and its parent, Arthur J. Gallagher, Inc</i>. We may share your personal information with other group companies for marketing purposes (subject to applicable laws or regulations), internal reporting and other purposes as described in this privacy notice.</li>
    <li><i>Law enforcement agencies, courts, regulators, government or quasi-governmental authorities or other third parties acting under the color of law</i>. We may share your personal information with these parties where we believe this is necessary to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation, to enforce or apply any agreements between us and you, to resolve any disputes, or otherwise to protect our rights or the rights of any third party.</li>
    <li><i>Asset purchasers</i>.  We will not sell your personal information to third parties other than to the extent reasonably necessary to proceed with the consideration, negotiation, or completion of a merger, reorganization, or acquisition of our business, or a sale, liquidation, or transfer of some or all of our assets.  Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to ensure that the entity to which we transfer your personal information uses it in a manner that is consistent with this privacy notice.</li>
    <li><i>Online ad technology firms</i>. We may transfer information about you to ad technology firms so that they may recognize your devices and deliver interest-based content and advertisements to you. The information may include your name, postal address, email, device ID, or other identifier in encrypted form. These firms may collect additional information from you, such as your IP address and information about your browser or operating system; may combine information about you with information from other companies in data sharing cooperatives in which we participate; and may place or recognize their own unique cookie on your browser.</li>
    
    </ul>
    <p>Because we operate as part of a global business, the recipients referred to above may be located outside the jurisdiction in which you are located (or in which we provide the Services). See the section on “International Data Transfer” below for more information.</p>
    <p>When required by applicable law, when we share personal information with corporate third parties we will ensure that such third parties maintain a comparable level of protection of the personal information as set out in this privacy notice by using contractual or other means.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we exclude all liability arising from the use of your personal information by third parties.  When required by applicable law, data transfers will be logged and documented, identifying the recipient of the data, the purpose of the transmission, and the type of data that was transmitted.  Where required by law to do so, we can on request confirm the name of each third party that personal information is, or will be, transferred to.</p>
    <h4>Information Security And Storage</h4>
    <p>We implement technical, organizational, administrative and physical measures to help ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk to the personal information we collect, use, disclose and process. These measures are aimed at ensuring the on-going integrity and confidentiality of personal information. We evaluate these measures on a regular basis to help ensure the security of the processing. However, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure, and although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of information as it is transmitted to our websites or apps. As such, any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use appropriate procedures and security features to help prevent unauthorized access.</p>
    <p>We limit internal access to our servers and have physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards in place to guard all personal information that we receive from visitors to our websites and apps. At Low Cost Insurance, we adhere to high standards of ethics and integrity in performing our jobs and conducting business. However, it should be noted that there are some things, such as viruses and hacker attacks, which Low Cost Insurance cannot control.</p>
    <p>Please note that the information we collect from you may be processed, transferred, and/or stored outside of your country of residence.  Such location may not be deemed to have the same level of privacy protections as your country of residence; however, Low Cost Insurance will take all steps reasonably necessary to help ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  By submitting your personal information, you agree to this processing, transfer, usage, and/or storage outside of your country of residence.</p>
    <p>Low Cost Insurance disposes of Personal Information in a secure manner by destroying or permanently erasing electronic data, and by disposing of hard copy data via burning, pulverizing, or utilizing shredding methods designed to ensure that Personal Information cannot be read or reconstructed.</p>
    <p>We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
    <h4>Secure communications</h4>
    <p>Live chat sessions on our site are encrypted to encode information that you share with our operators. By contrast, be aware that email messages sent in clear text over the public internet can be observed by an unintended third party. Non-encrypted Internet e-mail communications may be accessed and viewed by other internet users without your knowledge and permission while in transit to us. If you wish to keep your information private, please do not use electronic mail to communicate information to us or request information from us that you consider to be confidential and/or proprietary. If you wish, you may contact us instead via telephone at the phone number provided elsewhere in this website.</p>
    <h4>Third-party vendors</h4>
    <p>For certain services on our website, such as live chat or webcasts, we will ask for information about you such as your name, business, and email address. In cases where we use a third-party vendor to provide online services, the vendor has agreed to keep your information confidential. For example, transcripts of live chat sessions may be archived in a database by our vendor for review by our operators.</p>
    <h4>Links To Other Sites</h4>
    <p>We may provide links to other websites not owned or controlled by us that we think might be useful or of interest to you. We are not, however, responsible for the privacy practices used by other website owners or the content or accuracy contained on those other websites. Links to other websites do not constitute or imply endorsement by us of those web sites, any products or services described on those websites or any other material contained in them. We advise that you contact any third party websites directly for their individual privacy policies.</p>

    <p>We may transfer certain personal information across geographical borders to our affiliates, subsidiaries, our parent, Risk Placement Services, Inc. (“RPS”), RPS’s parent company, Arthur J. Gallagher, Inc., or service providers (working in conjunction with us or on our behalf) worldwide. Such transfers are made in accordance with applicable law.</p>

    <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time.  We encourage you to periodically review this website for any updates or changes. Low Cost Insurance will advise users of this website of material changes to this Privacy Policy by posting a prominent notice on the Site homepage.
